Originally, this project was worked on for my last high school chemistry class mandatory creative project where students are able to contribute to future class materials.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish polishing the app and porting it to mobile. Hopefully, by open sourcing the project people can find out about this and expand the app beyond what it currently is.

## Development Specs
> Godot 4.2.1<br/>
> Mobile render engine<br/>
> Export options: Windows
